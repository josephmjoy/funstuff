Processing code to create cut files for R & J's "15 Puzzle" (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/15_puzzle). Actually it is modified - 5x7, and with engraving patterns.
The program allows for different puzzle designs. Currently the code for the algorthmically-generated pattern for the frame is part of this folder.

#Cushiongrab - OpenSCAD Textured Sutface to grab cushions

The texture is formed by rows of trangular extrusions. The trangles are rt-angled triangles, with the "sharp" edge
facing backwards. The overall shape looking from above is a rounded square - though that could be paremetrized. The
ends of each row is rounded. The plan for rounding the square and edges is to difference the rectangular pattern
with a kind of rounded square dome.

Triangle dimensions - 2mm each square side.
Row separation: 2mm.
Thickness of base: 1mm.
Rounded rectangle radius: 20mm.
Dome height/radius: 3mm (tri height + base height).

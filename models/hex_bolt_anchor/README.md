# Hex Nut Bolt Anchor
This insert fits into a cylindrical depression in wood. It is glued in place.
It snugly fits a hex bolt (or nut, actually) preventing it from rotating. The bolt(nut) is not glued - it is intended to be removable.
There is a space beneath to place a steel washer to distribute the load from
the nut to the wood below. This washer must remain free, not glued. The
only glued surface should be the cylindrical (curved) surface of the insert
to the surrounding wood.

The maximum stress on the insert will be the areas closest to the hex head.

The insert should be printed upside down, with the washer depression above.
There are no overhangs.

Initial use case: a DIY clamp using 2x4 lumber and threaded rods.

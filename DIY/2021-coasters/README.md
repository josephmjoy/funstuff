# Coasters: XMASS Secret Santa Gift for MV
The coaster design by me (JMJ) has a scalloped outline so that coasters can be stacked compactly. Pins that stick up out of one fit into a space left by the coaster above. This design is unique, as far as I know. Don't know how effective it will be in practice.

The design is constructed in Inkscape.

The engraved pattern has closeups of different parts of an elephants. The source images were taken from the following links, and the heavily modified (chiefly, cropping to make it visually interesting, then adjusting levels to make it suitable for engraving).

# File Descriptions
- coasters-base.svg: the base pattern, including the mask (in black) for intersecting with the coaster image.
- coasters-felt.svg: pattern for the felt base. This base is inset by about 0.04in from the boundary. That is approximately the outer extent of the holes, which it is also intended to cover (the felt pattern has no holes). There is a hole in the center - this is to expose the wooden base to hand-write in an inscription (this would be under the coaster, so normally not visible).

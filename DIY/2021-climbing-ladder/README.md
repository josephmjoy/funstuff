# Climbing Ladder Designs
This "ladder" (it's not really a ladder) is two vertical 2x3" pieces of lumber that are mounted to the wall on either side of a doorway. Attached to it are hooks, at different levels. One or more 2x3" pieces go across the hooks, each forming a horizontal bar at a particular height.
